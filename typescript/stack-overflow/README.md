## Running

> ❗ Remember to [setup transform-hub locally](https://docs.scramjet.org/transform-hub/installation) or use the [platform's environment](https://docs.scramjet.org/platform/get-started/) for the sequence deployment.

Open the terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
# go to 'stack-overflow' directory
cd typescript/stack-overflow

# install dependencies
npm install

# transpile TS->JS to dist/
npm run build

# deploy the Sequence from the dist/ directory, which contains transpiled code, package.json and node_modules
si seq deploy dist --args '[minutes, "request_key"]'
# "request_key" argument is optional, e.g.: si seq deploy dist --args [1]

# See Instance output
si inst output -

# Optional commands below:

# Check console.log messages
si inst stdout -

# Check console.error messages
si inst stderr -
```

> 💡**NOTE:** Command `deploy` performs three actions at once: `pack`, `send` and `start` the Sequence. It is the same as if you would run those three commands separately:

```bash
si seq pack dist/ -o stack-overflow.tar.gz    # compress 'dist/' directory into file named 'stack-overflow.tar.gz'

si seq send stack-overflow.tar.gz    # send packed Sequence to STH, this will output Sequence ID

si seq start - --args [minutes, \"request_key\"]  # start the Sequence with arguments ("request_key" argument is optional), this will output Instance ID
```
