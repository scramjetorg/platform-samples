## Running
> üí°**NOTE:** Packaging of Python Sequences is not very "pythonic" for now. If you have any idea, how we should resolve it for your comfort, please let us know [here](https://github.com/scramjetorg/transform-hub/issues/598).

> ‚ùó Remember to [setup transform-hub locally](https://docs.scramjet.org/platform/self-hosted-installation) or use the [platform's environment](https://docs.scramjet.org/platform/quick-start) for the sequence deployment.

Open the terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
# Make sure you are inside 'rpilocator-scraper' directory, otherwise:
cd python/rpilocator-scraper

# Install dependencies
npm run build

# Deploy sample to STH
si seq deploy dist

# Get the output
si topic get <topicName>

```

If any new stock comes up, it will be written into the stream.
